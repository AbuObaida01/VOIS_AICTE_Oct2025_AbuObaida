# Airbnb Booking Analysis

This project analyzes the Airbnb open dataset using Python to uncover insights about listing types, prices, and neighborhood trends.
The workflow includes data cleaning (handling missing values and data types), followed by exploratory data visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Highlights
- Most listings are "Entire home/apt" or "Private room"
- Wide spread of prices, median price around $600
- Price distributions vary across neighborhoods
